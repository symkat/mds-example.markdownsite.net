# Once Twas A Joint Of Lands

_Namby Pamby_ is no clown,

London Bridge is broken down:

Now he courts the gay lay-dee

dancing o'er the Lady-Lee.

# No Loitering

Humpty Dumpty sate on a wall,

Humpti Dumpti had a great fall;

Threescore men and threescore more,

Cannot place Humpty dumpty as he was before.

# Look Both Ways

Hickory, dickory, dock,

The mouse ran up the clock;

The clock struck one,

And down he run,

Hickory, dickory, dock.

## Well hello there!

It seems *you've* found **my** secret page!

| Also | Tables   |
|------|----------|
| They | Do stuff |
| like | are good |
| at   | being    |
| a    | table    |

1. Row row row your boot
2. gentally down the stream
3. merrily merrily, 
4. life is but a dream

* Two blind mice, two blind mice
* knock one down, turn it around,
* why are you doing this to mice?

Check by Monday for another update!
