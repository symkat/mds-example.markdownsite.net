Well, I suppose I should start at the beginning.

The year was 1962 and there was a smell in the air.  It was like coffee, but it wasn't coffee.  It was deperation.

So anyway, it was 1978 and I was smelling the coffee when this gal walked in off the street out of the rain and right into my life.  I knew right then, this was going to be the case of a lifetime.

You see, she didn't know it right then, but she was going to be part of an exposition.
